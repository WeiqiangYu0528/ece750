# ECE 750: Engineering Self-Adaptive Software Systems (ESASS)

This repository houses assignments and the final project for ECE750. The assignments focus on extending the basic AcmeAir website with self-adaptivity using the MAPE-K loops framework. Specifically, Assignment One emphasizes the Monitor, Assignment Two centers on the Analyzer, and Assignment Three addresses the Planner and Executor.

## Assignments
1. **Assignment One: Monitor**
2. **Assignment Two: Analyzer**
3. **Assignment Three: Planner and Executor**

## Final Project
The final project extends a prior ECE651 project (Waterloo Instagram Website), transforming back-end services into microservices and incorporating adaptive features through applying knowledge gained in this course.

Notably, there are three main adaptive features:
1. Increase/decrease pod number based on current network traffic
2. Increase/decrease image quality (resolution)
3. Increase/decrease image loading number

Explore the project report in the repository for more details. Have fun exploring!
